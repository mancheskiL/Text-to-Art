The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally coudln't see straight. It took more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually return to itsnormal location. Between the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight months before I could drive a car again. At physical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a straight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, but there were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and overwhelemd.
